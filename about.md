Hi, I'm Christian, and I'm big on personal development. Since 2017, I stepped up my reading efforts, setting a goal of 30 books per year. I've yet to hit each year's target, but I've picked up a whole lot.

Two important things that I've learnt from my journey so far in becoming a more diligent reader are:

1. We can't possibly remember everything we read, unless we have an incredible memory; and
2. We have limited time to prioritise and read quality books.

As such, my approach has been to capture the essence of each book and keep bits of information that I resonate most strongly with. To keep track of these nuggets, I intend to record and share them with everyone through this mini blog.
