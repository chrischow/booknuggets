This book was full of little facts grouped (quite poorly) into a number of categories: home, social world, time, decision making, and business. These same facts were presented in a much more organised and holistic fashion in other books on psychology. If there was one theme that was common throughout the book, it was: externalise your memory, because your brain does not have enough RAM to remember everything. Put things like contacts, to-do lists, your schedule, decision making checklists, and so on into a cloud-enabled storage for access anywhere, anytime.
