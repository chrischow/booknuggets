1. Data governance is the formulation of policy to optimise, secure, and leverage information as an enterprise asset by aligning the objectives of multiple functions.
2. Successful data governance requires:
    1. Strong business ownership with IT support.
    2. Focus on critical data elements.
    3. Emphasis on data artifacts like business terms, business rules, policies, standards, and processes.
    4. Alignment around metrics and policy enforcement
    5. Celebration of quick wins with alignment around the long-term roadmap.
3. Policies, Standards, and Processes must be articulated clearly.
    1. Policies are high-level statements on how data should be handled.
    2. Standards are detailed rules to implement a policy.
    3. Processes are specific instructions to implement a standard.
