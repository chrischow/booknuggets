This was an incredible read for me because (1) I felt understood as a spirited adult, and (2) I see some of these characteristics in my own kid and can apply these techniques to bring out the best in him.

Characteristics of a spirited child:
1. Intensity: Powerful reactions
2. Persistence: Unwilling to give up
3. Sensitivity: Respond to slight changes in the environment
4. Perceptiveness: Easily distracted
5. Adaptability: Uncomfortable with change
6. Regularity: Irregular patterns
7. Energy: A lot of it
8. First Reaction: Need time to warm up
9. Mood: Serious

I'll be summarising the advice from this book in a more readable way. Watch this space!
