1. The six components of fitness are speed, suppleness, strength, stamina, skills, and psychology.
2. Good technique: Run tall, relaxed, and balanced, falling into the next step; keep your head straight and still; pull with your arms; reach forward with your knees; keep your feet quick and quiet, landing on your forefeet.
3. Vary your training routine with a long run, fartleks, intervals, and recovery runs.
4. When nearing a race, train for feeling, not for fitness.
