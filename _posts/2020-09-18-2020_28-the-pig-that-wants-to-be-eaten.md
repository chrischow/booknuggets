This book made me think. A LOT. I was impressed by the mind-bending dilemmas that looked simple on the surface but were actually so much more complex. I particularly enjoyed the dilemmas about morality and religion. I wished that each dilemma was tagged with the specific branch of philosophy that they came under. That would have helped to guide further exploration in those topics.
