1. Intelligence is not rare among human beings. It is found in children at birth. With the right stimulation, the development of reasoning and problem-solving skills can be nurtured in young children.
2. The most important years of a child’s education are the first six years of life.
3. Children should be encouraged to develop a high degree of independence and autonomy.
4. Academic competition and accountability are not effective ways to motivate students to become well educated. They learn more effectively when school is seen as a safe, exciting, and joyful experience.
5.  There is a direct link between children’s sense of self-worth, empowerment, and self-mastery, and their ability to learn and retain new skills and information.
6. Children learn best through hands-on experience, real-world application, and problem solving, rather than through rote learning and testing.
