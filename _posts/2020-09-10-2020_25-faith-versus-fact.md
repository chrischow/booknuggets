I'm generally avoidant when it comes to discussion about science vs. religion because there generally aren't people who are willing to put down all assumptions to openly examine what could be true about the world. Given that a lot of content produced about the topic concerns the case for religion, this book was a breath of fresh air.

The author argues that the incompatibility lies in:

1. Conflicts of Method: Faith, authority as the arbiter of truth, and falsifiability.
2. Conflicts of Outcome: Science and religion don't always yield similar outcomes, which should be the case if they are alternative methods of apprehending truth
3. Conflicts of Philosophy: Science is about doubt, criticality, and scepticism, while religion generally isn't

I won't post the summary for the rest of the book because I'm avoidant af. But if you're willing to expand your worldview, this is an interesting read. I have only become more curious about the arguments from both sides. A question from the book that really got me thinking:

> Does it really matter whether what you believe about God is true - or don't you care?
