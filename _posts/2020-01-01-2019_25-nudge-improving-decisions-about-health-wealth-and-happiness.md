1. As a choice architect, you can influence behaviour. You can nudge.
2. People need nudges for decisions that are difficult and rare, for which they don't get prompt feedback, and when they have trouble understanding the situation.
3. In designing choices, we should structure incentives well, understand the relation between choices and outcomes, provide good defaults, give feedback on decisions, expect errors, and structure complex choices.
