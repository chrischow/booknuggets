To adopt a growth mindset:

1. Embrace your fixed mindset. We are a mix of growth and fixed mindsets.
2. Be aware of your fixed-mindset triggers. When does it surface? When you're pressured? When you're challenged?
3. Give your fixed-mindset persona a name. This helps with internal communication.
4. Educate your fixed-mindset persona. Acknowledge him/her when he/she emerges, then show him/her the growth-mindset way of doing things.
