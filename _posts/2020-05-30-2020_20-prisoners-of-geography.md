Sovereignty issues stem from the same desires and fears:
1. The desire to safeguard routes for military and commercial shipping
2. The fear of the "other"
3. The desire to own the natural riches of a region
4. The fear that others may gain where you lose

Geography defines what a nation is or can be. Countries will always operate within the confines of geography:
* Vulnerable points and strategic depth influence foreign policy and defence policy
* Natural resource endowment, climate and natural connectivity affect economic potential
* Terrain affects socio-cultural division

This book is a must-read for understanding global politics. Highly recommended!
