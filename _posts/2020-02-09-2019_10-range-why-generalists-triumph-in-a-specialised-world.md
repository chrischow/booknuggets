As the world becomes increasingly complex, we inherit interconnected systems in which each individual only sees a small part. We need more people who start broad and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives while they progress - people with range.

Deep specialisation is important in kind learning environments, where patterns repeat and feedback is rapid. In wicked learning environments, rules are unclear and incomplete, and there may not be repetitive patterns. This is where we need range.

### On Learning
Make it challenging with few hints and maximum autonomy to discover the underlying concepts. Provide space between learning.

### On Thinking
Use analogical thinking, where you identify problems or situations with deep s tructural/concceptual similarities across multiple domains. Solutions can be found in experiences far outside of your domain.

### On Finding Your Place
Too much grit is no good. The key idea is to establish a good fit between what you do and your natural inclinations and abilities, instead of continuing down a rigid path. Test various paths, gather information, and increasingly refine decisions on where to allocate energy and effort.

### On Deep Expertise
Too much expertise is bad. It could result in the tendencies to (1) predict extremes, (2) fail to see flaws in judgement, and (3) bend the world to fit what you know. Instead, accept ambiguity and contradiction by aggregating perspectives, putting pride and disagreement aside. Search for why you're wrong.
