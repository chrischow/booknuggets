The Epicycle of Analysis:

1. Stating and Refining the Question
2. Exploring the Data
3. Building Formal Statistical Models
4. Interpreting the Results
5. Communicating the Results

The Three Core Activities (applicable to all activities above):

1. Setting expectations
2. Collecting or generating information
3. Matching expectations to the information/data. If there is a mismatch, either the expectations, model, or interpretations were wrong.
