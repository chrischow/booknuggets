Scrum, an approach that:

1. Focuses on delivering value incrementally through regular product demos to key stakeholders for feedback.
2. Works in Sprints, cycles of fixed duration to achieve tasks chosen by the team.
3. Employs small teams (3-9 pax) that decide how many things they will do, and how they will do them.
4. Emphasises process improvement to enhance team performance, not individual performance.
5. Can be applied in any endeavour to improve performance and results.
