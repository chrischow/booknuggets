It has been at least 8 years since I last read a fiction book, and I decided to read one to see what I was missing out on - and it seems I've missed out on a lot.

This novella was amazing. It captured some interesting themes like what is a soul and what is art. One thing that stood out to me was how qualities like honesty and kindness, while virtuous, can be used to manipulate others for selfish ends.

Strongly recommended!
