I felt almost guilty clocking this as a book because it only had about 120 pages, but it was full of excellent practical tips on machine learning. Given that almost each one of the 57 content chapters had unique insights, it is difficult to summarise the book in a more concise form than it already is while still being clear about the techniques and rationale behind them.

This is a must-read for every aspiring data scientist.
