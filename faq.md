### How is BookNuggets organised?
The Home page is organised in chronological fashion. The latest nuggets (short summaries of books I've read) appear at the top left, and the earliest ones (since 2019) appear at the bottom right. I've also categorised the books into broader themes in the menu bar, namely: Psychology, Investment, Data, Health, and Others.

### Do all books have nuggets?
Just as you wouldn't eat McNuggets everyday, you wouldn't summarise all books you read. Sometimes, it's because you don't have an appetite for certain books. At other times, the nuggets just aren't fresh. And just as I'm considering eating McNuggets more often, I'm also considering writing summaries for all books, or at least leaving a comment on each one. Until then, you can identify books without nuggets by the red triangle at the top right of each thumbnail.

### Are nuggets a substitute for reading entire books?
Certainly not. Nuggets comprise bite-sized pieces of information that (a) I thought formed the bases of the books, and (b) were salient to me at the point of reading. Someone else could offer a different perspective on what they thought the books were about, or pick out things that I would not have. My hope is that the nuggets will give you the gist of these books, and encourage you to pick them up and discover some delicious nuggets of your own.

### Can I share my own pointers on BookNuggets?
Hit me up. I would love to publish posts from contributors too. :)
